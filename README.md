# Canonization-Demo
Sample of code and graphs generated by the one-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman Method

This code was taken from a web application created to canonize graphs using the one and two dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman methods.
Graph canonization is used in graph isomorphism testing. The accompanying pdf is the research paper I read to learn about the algorithms 
in order to implement them.

The application was built using CGI, python, html and css. 
The visualizations were built using nextworkX and matplotlib.
